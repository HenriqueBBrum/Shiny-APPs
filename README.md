# Shiny-APPs

This repo consists of two shiny applications: A public security application and a public health (unfinished). <br>

Besides those, there are also the data csv files used for each app, a folder for a data creation python script (used to create crime data; read the readme on that folder for more info) and a folder ("Articles") containing related work.
